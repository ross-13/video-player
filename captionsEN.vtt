00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.260
The evening river has so many summer charms

2
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.160
We dive into a mirror of the peach colored clouds

3
00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:26.213
And when we finish, then we'll go to do workouts

4
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.160
So that ladies would be dreaming to touch us

5
00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:36.228
August is dying among puffy clouds

6
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.213
The diesel Â«Ikar*" will spread its wings tomorrow
(*Ikarus - Hungarian busses popular in the post-soviet countries)

7
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.905
And it will carry us to stratospheric and prodigal cities

8
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.021
That gonna obey us someday

9
00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:55.593
And the all best classmates

10
00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.059
They will regret it someday

11
00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:05.739
That under the bliss skies of Cherkaschyna

12
00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.999
They did not make out with us

13
00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:15.672
And the all best classmates

14
00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:20.144
They will regret it someday

15
00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:25.753
That under the bliss skies of Cherkaschyna,

16
00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:30.072
They did not make out with us

17
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.160
Night fell down and the cats came out

18
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.006
And we perfumed ourselves like teachers' sons

19
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.120
We go together to these ruthless discos

20
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.160
Tasty and defenseless, like "Artek" wafers

21
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.160
But our voyage will turn us into Mohicans

22
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.160
And Venus and Titan will obey us

23
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.760
And all the cats from stratospheric and prodigal cities

24
00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:30.551
They will meow at us one day

25
00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:35.461
And the all best classmates

26
00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:40.016
They will regret it someday

27
00:02:42.942 --> 00:02:45.609
That under the bliss skies of Cherkaschyna,

28
00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:49.974
They did not make out with us

29
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.770
And the all best classmates

30
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.129
They will regret it someday

31
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.680
That under the bliss skies of Cherkaschyna,

32
00:03:08.084 --> 00:03:10.030
They did not make out with us
